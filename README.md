Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) is an important component as well as one of the most under-estimated steps in any Data Science project. EDA is essential for well-defined and structured data analysis and should be performed before the machine learning modeling phase.

It involves finding insights from the data upon careful observation and further summarizing its main characteristics. Generally, the real-life data which we work upon contains a lot of ‘noise’, and therefore performing data analysis manually on such datasets becomes a complicated and tedious process.
I used Pandas for this analysis as it is one of the most popular libraries of Python that helps to present the data in a way which is suitable for analysis via its Series and DataFrame data structures.
